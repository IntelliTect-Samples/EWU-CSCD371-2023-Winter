    //in regards to garbage collecting. Ergo, I think by removing the rest of the list from this "head", they will all
    //inevitably be collected. Even if only iteratively and not in like one fell swoop.
    //For example, if you have a list A > B > C > D, and you were to call clear on B, then C would no longer be pointed to
    //and be collected. C getting collected means D is no longer pointed to and will be collected. Then D's collection
    //means A is no longer pointed to and would be collected. Leaving only the original node that called clear, B, remaining.
    //So while I'm unsure if they could all be taken at once, it seems to me that in the end they'd all be collected.
